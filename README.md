# WordGuessGame
This is a game that took some time to learn. :clock430::clock430::clock430:
HTML | CSS | JAVASCRIPT
I believe I had a firm grasp on HTML so I didn't bother too much with the styling of my page, as I was more worried about the Javascript | 
The same with CSS, I didn't style at all because I wanted a functioning game, I believe function is more important than aesthetics | I spent
SO much time working on the Javascript and struggling long nights with trying to figure out how DOM elements worked, but it all paid off
because I believe I am much more confident with them.

This game starts off by asking the user to hit the "new game" button to begin, and takes in your key presses, you have a total
of 9 chances to get the word. Win or Loss, you will need to hit the "new game" button again to play again, but the game will
keep track of your wins and losses. If you end up losing, the correct word will autofill the placeholders.
